### Activity 2: MG2 Progress
[Commits Made](https://github.com/UCI-GDIM32-W25/mg2-JeremyC140/commits/main/)
I finished the assets setup, the jumping of penguin (and isGrounded check), the UI with TMP_text (but not yet the update part), collision check in the penguin script, and attempt on the coin moving script as well as the game controller. 

TO-DO:
- Fix coins not moving
- Assign enough variables to update the text

### Activity 1:
- My advice: don't miss every of the little details in the rubric
- Table advice: read the rubric line by line, ask questions when stuck, don't procrastinate


### Activity 2:
- Q1: x = 10

- Q2: x = 2

- Q3: The Update function calls another private method called PrintMessage (), which sends a log of "hello world" to the console, for every frame that unity runs. 

- Q4: public class Example: Monobehaviour

- Q5: The Start function calls another private method called PrintMessage () embedding 10 as the parameter, which the method then sends a log of "x = 10" to the console, for only once when the game starts running. 

- Q6: the 10 in the parenthesis is the parameter that was sent to the method PrintMessage(), and as the method's argument x receives 10, "x = 10" is printed.

- Q7: The Transform is not defined and the computer wouldn't know which object it's supposed to translate.  

- Q8: Thus, Transform is supposed to be altered to _playerTransform in order to correctly assign the object for translate.
